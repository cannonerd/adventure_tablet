The Tablet of Adventure includes both Geohashed and hand-picked location-based adventures. The Geohashing mode calculates and shows on map the day's Geohashing goal in your area using xkcd's random adventure generating algorithm. You can request the application to show the easiest route to the chosen goal. When you reach your destination you can save a picture from the place and a few thoughts to your adventure log.

You can set the application to alert you if today's Geohashing goal is within your set limitations or when your friends share an adventure.

You can also challenge your friends to take part in an adventure. The inviter sets a goal, and invites friends to join the race. Or one could invite friends to race current day's Geohashing goal. The competitors' location updates would show in your map.

The program would be written in Python and developed out in the open using GitHub. Libraries utilized in the project include libchamplain for map visualization, libmidgard2 for storage and geoclue or liblocation for user location.
